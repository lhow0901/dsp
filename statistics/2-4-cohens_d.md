[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)
Using the variable `totalwgt_lb`, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?


>> The following are the descriptive statistics I computed in this python file [2-4cohens_d.py](https://github.com/lhow0901/dsp/edit/master/statistics/2-4-cohens_d.py)  
>>
>> First babies n =  4413  
>> Other babies n =  4735  
>> 
>> First babies mean =  7.2  lbs  
>> Other babies mean =  7.33  lbs  
>> 
>> First babies sd =  1.42  
>> Other babies sd =  1.39  
>>
>> Cohen's *d* for firsts vs others =  -0.09

>>
>>Although the means show that first babies tend to weigh slightly less than other babies, the Cohen's *d*  value tells us that the effect size is very small. Any absolute value under .2 is considered very small.  
>>
>>For practical purposes, pregnant women would not experience any meaningful difference in the weight of their first babies compared with later ones.
